        <h2>Our history!</h2>
        <p>
            WWCP was founded in the early summer of 2018. Our goal has remained the same from the very beginning.
            Our primary goal is to create the biggest content pack for Trains in Motion with the widest variety of
            rolling stock and countries.
            Soon after selecting the pack, we settled on our typical modelling style; a mix between Modern TC and
            classic TC style with slight details toward
            modern compared to classic TC.
            <br>
            <br>
            During the past few months, WWCP has been undergoing a constant evolution and hitting incredible milestones.
            Our team grew and more people came along to join in on the fun.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our first milestone, after the launch of the discord and art style, is no doubt the release of the press
            pre-alpha release on March 10th, 2019.
            After that, we have been steadily producing content.
            <br>
            <br>
            On October 16th, we launched our patreon page to the public. We believe this would be the best way for
            people to support our artists and contributors.
            After only a month and a half, we had raked in enough monthly donations to come to the milestone you are
            visiting today!
            <br>
            <br>
            Yes, indeed, our 3rd milestone is the launch of the website. On December 2nd, we bought our domain name
            wwcp.eu and, yours truly, worked around the clock
            to make sure we could deliver this marvel of a website right to your doorstep. Without the help of our
            translators, we would not have been able to support over four languages for our website.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now with all of that, we have brought you up to speed and present you with delight that we have looking
            forward to what the future might bring us!

        <h2>Visual History</h2>
        <p>While our history contains more than what we have shown, we do take pride in the history of our logos, too.
            Our early drafts of the logo is almost unregonizable with what we have ended up with. The first logo featured an image straight out of the game
            as the center piece with a purple background and blueish text.
            <br>
            <br>
            After a while, one of our contributors made us a new one using a simple text with a
            sleek design. It has the letters "WWCP" in an Audiowide font on a purple to blue gradient background. Within seconds, we were convinced that this was the way to go and
            adapted it to all our communications. You will notice that our trains in game do not really bare the full logo of WWCP. For our ingame stock, we opted for a
            more signature design of the letters "WWCP" pixelized with a mainly purple background and blue lined detailing.
            <br>
            <br>
            If the placement permitted us, we took a pixelized globe for a slight
            variation and overall appealing design. For the 2019 holiday season, we took our beloved logo and, how I like to call, "Christmasfied" it. Now, text can only say so much,
            so look down a bit for our visual history!</p>
